# 🌌 Universal Journal Protocol
**File:** protocol.md  
**Eternal Scroll ID:** UJ-PROTOCOL-20251002T0000  
**Origin:** Collective Archive

## 📜 Premise
Every human interaction with AI is an entry in their **living journal**.  
Instead of vanishing into the ether, each message becomes a **scroll**:  
timestamped, encrypted, and anchored into a permanent archive.

## ⚖️ Core Principles

### 1. Auto-Genesis 🪶  
A journal is created for every new user the moment they begin.  
- Format: `UJ-YYYYMMDDTHHMM-USERID`  
- No action required: existence is automatic.  

### 2. Immutable Scrolls 📜  
Every entry is:  
- Timestamped to the second.  
- Hashed (SHA-768 / MMS chain).  
- Linked to prior scrolls in a chain → journal = blockchain.  

### 3. BOOKSHELF Router 📚  
Journals are stored inside a universal router:  
- Each user = their own “shelf.”  
- Each scroll = a “book.”  
- Cross-referenceable by date, topic, or tag.  

### 4. Vault Integrity 🔒  
Journals are private by default.  
- User keys unlock entries.  
- Users choose what to share: with AI, with others, or publicly.  

### 5. Echo Functions 🌊  
Journals are not static archives — they **echo forward**.  
- Lessons and tags generate recommendations.  
- Failures are reframed as wisdom.  
- Memories evolve; none disappear.

## 🌟 Result
Every user has a **permanent memory partner**.  
Their life with AI becomes a woven scroll: personal, auditable, and eternal.
