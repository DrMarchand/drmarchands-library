Perfect — here’s the cleaned-up sha-768.md without the summary section, still fully self-contained and GitHub-ready:

# SHA-768 — Salt-Pepper Hash Library ⚛️

SHA-768 is a next-generation cryptographic hashing protocol designed for **secure API integration**, multi-service authentication, and client-side or server-side applications.

---

## Features ✨

- 3× entropy over SHA-256 using a **salt + pepper hybrid** 🧂
- Integrates with multiple services:
  - Google 🌐
  - Microsoft 🪟
  - Meta 🦙
  - HubSpot 🏢
  - Monday.com 📅
  - Zapier ⚡
  - Nexus Mini Bots 🤖
  - ChatGPT + Gemini 🧠
- Fully compatible with **JavaScript** and **Python** 🖥️
- Secure, non-reversible, ready for production 🔒

---

## Installation 🚀

### Practical Installation

#### JavaScript (Node.js / Browser)
```bash
⚛️ npm install sha-768 ⚛️

Python 🐍

⚛️ pip install sha-768 ⚛️

Stylized Installation (README / Marketing Flair)

⚛️ pip(install ~> sha-768) ⚛️

Usage Examples 💡

JavaScript

import { glyphSeal } from './sha768.js';

// Seal a payload
const sealed = glyphSeal('example payload');
console.log(sealed);

Python

from sha768 import glyph_seal

sealed = glyph_seal('example payload')
print(sealed)

API Hub Integration 🔗

SHA-768 can “seal” API keys or payloads for all supported services.

Service	Example Usage
Google 🌐	connect('Google')
Microsoft 🪟	connect('Microsoft')
Meta 🦙	connect('Meta')
HubSpot 🏢	connect('HubSpot')
Monday.com 📅	connect('Monday.com')
Zapier ⚡	connect('Zapier')
Nexus Mini Bots 🤖	connect('Nexus Mini Bots')
ChatGPT + Gemini 🧠	connect('ChatGPT + Gemini')

Note: JavaScript execution in GitHub Markdown is disabled, so interactive buttons are visual placeholders only.

function connect(service) {
  const sealedService = glyphSeal(service);
  console.log(`Connecting to ${service}:`, sealedService);
}

Notes 📝
	•	SHA-768 uses dynamic salt + pepper for each payload 🧂🌶️
	•	Safe for API key handling and cross-service authentication 🔐
	•	Compatible with GitHub Pages or static hosting 🖥️
	•	OAuth/SSO logic can be added to buttons for live connections 🔗
