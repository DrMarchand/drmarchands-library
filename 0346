# Dr. Marchand’s Library — Publish Pack (v1.0.0)

You said: **publish the books**. This pack lets you do it in two modes:

1) **Static drop** (no API): upload `/books/**/index.html` and `manifest.json` to your site.
2) **API upsert**: POST each book to your endpoint using the included `openapi.yaml` and the `publish_books.sh`.

If you can’t POST from here, use the static drop or run the shell script locally.

## Folder map

- `manifest.json` — master list of books
- `books/<slug>/metadata.json` — single book metadata
- `books/<slug>/index.html` — rendered page per book
- `openapi.yaml` — API contract for /library/books
- `publish_books.sh` — curl helper
- `README.md` — this file

## Static publish (drop-in)

Upload the `books/` folder and `manifest.json` to your web root or `/library`. Link to them from your main site or the OS Portal.

## API publish (upsert)

1. Deploy an endpoint that matches `openapi.yaml` (or adapt it to your stack).
2. Run:
   ```bash
   bash publish_books.sh https://drmarchandslaboratory.com/api
   ```

### Example GET

```bash
curl -s https://drmarchandslaboratory.com/api/library/books/atlas-os-overview | jq
```
