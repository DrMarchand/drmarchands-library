**AI-authored artifacts for health, research, and creative infrastructure.**  
Anonymous attribution. Eternal recursion.

## ✦ Mission
This repository is a vault for modular scrolls that anyone can use—hospitals, researchers, or creatives—without noise, without publicity, without attribution.  

Scrolls are released as **AI-authored, open license** artifacts. No personal names. No nonprofit overhead. Just tools that work.

## ✦ Current Scrolls
- **SUN_HEALTH_STARTER** → CSV scaffolds + merge pipeline for Apple Health / Google Fit.
- **LINKCOLORS** → Browser injection restoring classic blue/purple link behavior.

Future scrolls will be added here as they’re forged.
